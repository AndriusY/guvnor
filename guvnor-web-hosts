; # Host configuration
;
; Hosts should follow this format:
;
; [hostname]
;   host = my.host.com
;   port = port number
;   user = user the daemon runs as on my.host.com
;   key = user key
;   secret = longish string
;
; You may omit the host and port options - if so ${remote.advertise} should be true in /etc/boss/bossrc on that host
